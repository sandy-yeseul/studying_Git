0. initialize repository to the git: git git init
1. create file: nano
2. check the status: git status
 - showing worktree
3. add untracked file to the working stage: git add filename
	git add . : adding all file that's in current directory
	git add foldername: adding all file inside the folder
4. check status: git status
5. commit to git: git commit -m "Message"
 -m meaning easier to type message only(don't know how to get out from the editing page)
	commiting all: git commit -am "Message"
	warning: if there's untracke file, it can't be commited.
	at least it should be added once
6. finished. check status if anything missing: git status
7. showing log in git: git log
* going back to previous commit: git reset --hard
* showing the difference between git commited file and workingtree file:
	git diff
* showing all the log details: git log -p (p meaning patch)
* go back to the previous commit in the repository: git checkout "id"
	id is the git commit's id
	than you can get the previous commit version in repository as well
	it's not deleting it's going back 
* go to the most recent version(commit): git checkout master
